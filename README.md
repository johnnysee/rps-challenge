# Rock - Paper - Scissors Challenge

## Project Overview

This project was presented 17th September 2021 with a 14-day deadline (1st October 2021). It is an individual challenge, where I (Johnny See) plant to implement most of it in React.

I plan to use an agile approach to this with Test Driven Development, mainly using tools such as Cypress and Jest.

The Customer/User in this case is Craft Academy, where I will present my planning, problems and the results on Mondays and Fridays.
